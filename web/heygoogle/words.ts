// Display-only fingerprinting: render an arbitrary byte buffer as a sequence of
// real words, 10 bits per word against a fixed 1024-word table. Used to show a
// public key as a word phrase instead of a base64 blob — easier to read aloud
// and to eyeball-compare, and resistant to look-alike keys that merely share a
// base64 prefix. Not reversible and not meant to be; purely for human
// verification.
//
// The table is the 1024 most frequent English words (deduped, frequency order)
// from the letterfast corpus, so common keys map to familiar words.
